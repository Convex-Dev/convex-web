# Vision

Convex is foundational technology for the **Internet of Value**. 

Throughout history, people have improved their lives and societies by exchanging good and services to fulfil their needs. Marketplaces, trade routes, legal systems, currencies and financial institutions developed to support value exchange over the centuries. 

In the modern world, assets are increasingly managed with digital systems, and in many cases are entirely digital themselves. However the facilities to enable value to be exchanged for such assets are still mostly dependent on traditional and inefficient mechanisms:

- Contracts are costly to write and agree, and enforced via expensive lawyers and slow legal systems 
- Payments are managed via huge centralised financial institutions with high transaction costs
- Fiat currencies are issued at the whim of national governments, and carry notable risks as a long term store of value (inflation, safe custody)
- Significant risks plague the economic system (operational risk, systematic financial risk etc.) which make value exchange dangerous and create a requirement for burdensome due diligence
- Many individuals are excluded from participation in the financial system, because of significant barriers and costs

We can do better. 

Convex provides the foundation for efficient digital value exchange. It is a ground-up re-imagining and robust implementation of what is needed to support efficient, transparent and fair economic systems in the digital age.

## Our Values

Our mission is to create the Internet of Value with the same spirit as the original Internet. We believe in:

- Decentralised operations
- Simple, stable, foundational protocols (consistent with the "end-to-end principle")
- Network neutrality (freedom of expression, no censorship)
- Good governance of the network as a public good
- Open standards
- Open source development
- Universal access - open to everyone
- Protection of individual rights (especially ownership and privacy)
- Unlimited opportunity to innovate and build

## What Convex makes possible

There are no limitations on the types of digital value exchange applications or assets that you can build with Convex. Convex smart contracts are fully programmable and "Turing Complete", so you can build anything.

Convex is also open and free to use. So you don't need anyone's permission to build. Just do it.

Here are some examples:

- **Digital currencies** (stablecoins, central bank currencies, commercial bank notes)
- **Real asset ownership** (real estate, high value goods)
- **Digital equities** (shares in real world companies)
- **Derivatives** (futures and options on other digital assets)
- **Digital Autonomous Organisations** (virtual companies)
- **Games** involving digital asset ownership
- **Digital licensing**
- **Immutable provenance** for data or asset authenticity, e.g. for regulatory usage
- **Public databases**
- **Self-sovereign identity**

We're already seeing some exciting projects prototyping new ideas with Convex, and 

## What we are delivering

To realise our vision, the Convex Foundation and core team are building:

* **Global Database**: A consistent, replicated database capable of tracking all assets in circulation, and public information required to facilitate atomic transactions. This must be scalable enough to handle internet scale usage (e.g. VISA-like transaction volumes)
* **Consensus Algorithm**: An algorithm is required to ensure verifiable consensus across the network, so that ownership of assets / execution of contracts can be uniquely and reliably determined (avoiding the infamous "double spend" problem)
* **Convex Coin**: The Convex Coin is required to pay transaction costs to use the network. It serves as the native currency to pay for network utilities (transaction fees, Peer staking etc.). Like Bitcoin, it has a *limited supply* guaranteed by the protocol.
* **Secure Ownership**: Secure cryptographic techniques are needed ensure that on-chain assets are under the control of the owner, and nobody else. Control over assets can be exercised only via transactions signed with a specific private key.
* **Trusted Execution**: Deterministic, programmable, verifiable smart contracts are required so that participants can rely upon then to precisely enforce terms and conditions of value exchange. The platform that enables trusted execution is the Convex Virtual Machine (CVM)
* **Autonomous Actors**: Self-operating, "unstoppable" economic agents executing on the network can fulfil important roles in the digital economy, perhaps operating as virtual companies in their own right.
* **Core Libraries**: A set of open source libraries designed to help developers quickly and efficiently build powerful decentralised applications with Convex. This includes important "Internet of Value" functionality such as fungible tokens, trust monitors and re-usable smart contract capabilities.
* **Public Utility Network** A decentralised, public, permissionless network that anyone can access to transact without censorship or centralised gatekeepers.

We already have all the above working in our test networks. After a period of public development and refinement, this will transition rapidly towards the launch of the main network.

## Good Governance

It is not sufficient to simply deliver technology. The Internet of Value needs good governance.

We require mechanisms that ensure the network is **governed effectively and efficiently** now and in the future, in the joint interests of all builders, users and coin holders. Convex is a shared public utility that everyone can use.

To achieve this, we are establishing the **Convex Foundation**, an organisation that will be responsible for building, delivering and managing the Convex public network. 

We do **not allow forks** in the Convex main network. This is for the following reasons:

- Forks are harmful to users in the ecosystem - they create uncertainty over asset holdings, and which fork to build upon. A fragmented Internet of Value is a future we wish to avoid.
- From an economic perspective, forks destroy value by subdividing the market and making cross-fork transactions more difficult and complex.
- Forks create unnecessary political problems, which are a distraction and risk to people involved in the ecosystem.
- Technical improvements can and should be evaluated on their merits and rolled out responsibly.

Initially the Foundation will be managed by the founding team. Over time, key ecosystem stakeholders will be invited to take appropriate governance roles. Our long term goal is to achieve decentralised governance, jointly owned by participants in the broader ecosystem. We don't want to set a fixed date for this, but it is our aspiration that we should move to fully decentralised governance after around **5 years** of successful operation of the main network.

We will adopt "on-chain governance" mechanisms where practical, but it is important to note that such solutions are currently unproven and there will always be some situations that requires off-chain governance.

## Design Principles

Convex is built according to the following design principles:

* **Self-Sovereignty** - Individuals should have ownership and control of their own digital identity and assets
* **Neutrality** - The Convex platform and governance shall be totally neutral to all users, and will never censor legitimate transactions.
* **Decentralisation** - The network must be decentralised, both as a technical platform and as far as possible in network governance
* **Sustainability** - Convex technology is efficient and environmentally sustainable, and in particular does not create an incentive to waste energy or computational resources (e.g. Proof of Work). Users pay the full and fair costs of any network resources they consume.  
* **Simplicity** - Convex is simple, in the sense that it is based on foundational concepts and building blocks that are robust and reusable. We support the "end-to-end principles".
* **Unbreaking** - We aspire to zero breaking changes or forks in the production network. The only such changes that will be allowed are to fix systematic threats to network security or governance.
* **Builders First** - Individuals and organisations that invest their time and money in building the Convex platform and ecosystem will own all newly issued coins, and shall have the greatest influence over future direction

## Community and Ecosystem

The Convex Foundation will work to create the conditions for an open, decentralised ecosystem of people and organisations building solutions for the Internet of Value.

We are committed to:

- Encouraging participation in the development of Convex, through mechanisms such as open source development and bounty programmes
- Investing, where appropriate, in creating additional infrastructure and standards that are important for the Internet of Value
- Fostering a inclusive community based on ethical principles, and supporting those who wish to create positive impact for the world with Convex
- Helping builders and entrepreneurs to be successful with their own projects using Convex

It is important to note, however, that the Convex Foundation does not "own" Convex. While the Foundation plays an important governance role and acts as a responsible steward of network integrity, ultimately Convex is an open technology that everyone is free to use, in the spirit of the original Internet.

To get involved with the community, the primary hub right now is the [Convex Discord Server](https://discord.gg/fsnCxEM) which hosts public discussion forums and live events:
