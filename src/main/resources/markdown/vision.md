Convex: *Pioneering a Descentralised Engine for Open Economic Systems!* 

Empowering visionaries, builders, and dreamers with a platform that inspires new and innovative economic models to emerge.

At it's core, Convex is a new kind of foundational technology for building an internet of value designed to enable open economic systems.

Throughout history, people have thrived by exchanging goods and services to fulfill their needs. From bustling marketplaces to intricate legal systems, the evolution of value exchange has shaped our communities.

In today's dynamic world, our assets are digitized, but the tools for exchanging value often lag behind:

- Traditional contracts are pricey and cumbersome, involving legions of lawyers and extensive legal hoops.
- Payments navigate through centralized financial giants, bearing hefty processing costs.
- Fiat currencies are issued at the discretion of national governments, posing risks like inflation and custody concerns.
- Economic systems face significant risks, demanding meticulous due diligence and complicating value exchange.
- Barriers and costs exclude many from the financial system.

But here's the rallying call: *We can do better!*

Convex doesn't just innovate; it transforms. It lays the groundwork for a seamless digital value exchange—a complete overhaul designed for today's needs. It's not just a tweak; it's a revolution, ushering in efficient, transparent, and fair open economic systems in the digital age.

Join us in shaping a future where value exchange is effortless, transparent, and accessible to all. 

Convex: *Pioneering a Decentralised Engine for Open Economic Systems!*


## Our Values

Our mission is to enable open economic systems by building the foundation for an internet of value in the same spirit as the original Internet. We believe in the following:

- Decentralised operations
- Simple, stable, foundational protocols (consistent with the "end-to-end principle")
- Network neutrality (freedom of expression, no censorship)
- Good network governance as a public good
- Open standards
- Open-source development
- Universal access - open to everyone
- Protection of individual rights (especially ownership and privacy)
- Unlimited opportunity to innovate and build.


## Unleashing Infinite Possibilities With Convex

Experience boundless creativity with Convex! Break free from limitations as Convex empowers you to create a diverse array of digital assets and applications, supporting open economic systems. Discover the full programmability and 'Turing Completeness' of Convex smart contracts, enabling you to build anything your imagination desires.

Utilizing Convex is also free and open to use. Thus, building with it does not require permission from anyone. Simply do it.

Here are some examples:

- **Digital currencies** (stablecoins, central bank currencies, commercial banknotes)
- **Ownership of tangible assets** (real estate, high-value goods)
- **Digital equities** (shares in real-world companies)
- **Derivatives** (futures and options on other digital assets)
- **Decentralised Autonomous Organisations** (virtual companies)
- **Games** utilising digital asset ownership
- **Digital distribution licenses**
- **Immutable provenance** for the authenticity of data or assets, such as for regulatory purposes
- **Public databases**
- **Self-sovereign identity**

We're experiencing a wave of exciting projects harnessing Convex to prototype groundbreaking concepts. With great anticipation, we look forward to witnessing a multitude of outstanding innovations yet to unfold.

## What We're Bringing to Life

**Global Database**: Imagine a consistent, replicated database that flawlessly keeps track of all circulating assets and public data crucial to facilitate atomic transactions. It's not just scalable; it's designed to handle internet-scale usage, like processing VISA-level transaction volumes.

**Consensus Algorithm**: Picture an algorithm that verifiably ensures everyone agrees on who owns what and uniquely and reliably executes contracts. This solves the notorious "double-spend" problem, making ownership and transactions rock-solid across the network.

**Convex Coin**: Meet the Convex Coin—your ticket to using the network. Just like Bitcoin, it has a *limited supply* guaranteed by the protocol. It's the native currency; it's what you use to power up the network, covering transaction fees and peer staking.

**Secure Ownership**: We have secure cryptographic techniques in place to make sure your assets are yours and yours alone. Your control is locked in, accessible only through transactions signed with a specific private key.

**Trusted Execution**: Think of it as a smart, execution platform—the Convex Virtual Machine (CVM). It ensures deterministic, programmable, and verifiable smart contracts are reliable and can be trusted. It enforces the terms and conditions of value exchange precisely.

**Autonomous Actors**: Meet the digital game-changers—self-operating, "unstoppable" economic agents. They play important roles in the digital economy, perhaps even operating like virtual companies in their own right.

**Core Libraries**: We're handing developers a toolkit—open-source libraries designed for building robust decentralised apps with Convex. It includes crucial *open economic system* features like fungible tokens, trust monitors, and reusable smart contract capabilities you’d expect for internet of value transactions.

**Public Utility Network** A decentralised, public, permissionless network that anyone can access to transact without censorship or centralised gatekeepers.
 
 **Already in Action:** This isn't just talk. We have all this working in our test networks. Next we launch a proto-net, and after some public fine-tuning, we're gearing up for the big launch of the main network. Exciting times ahead!


## Empowering Governance for All

In the vast realm of the open economic systems, it's not just about delivering technology—it's about embracing good governance.

**Shared Public Utility:** Convex isn't just for tech enthusiasts; it's a shared public utility open to everyone. We're not just building a network; we're building a community.  This requires mechanisms that ensure the network is **governed effectively and efficiently** now and in the future.

**The Convex Foundation:** Meet the driving force behind the scenes—the Convex Foundation. They're not just responsible for building and managing the Convex public network; they're the architects of a system that benefits everyone involved.

**No Room for Forks:** In our world, forks are a no-go. Why? Because they cause chaos for users, muddy the waters on asset holdings, and fracture open economic systems. We're steering clear of a fragmented future.

**Value Preservation:** Forget about forks destroying value. We're focused on unity, not division. By avoiding forks, we're keeping the market whole and transactions smooth.

**Beyond Politics:** Our goal is to minimize unnecessary political drama. Convex is about progress, not distractions. We're building a future where technical improvements are evaluated on their merits and embraced responsibly.

**Evolving Governance:** The Foundation kickstarts the governance journey, led by the founding team. As we grow, key ecosystem stakeholders will be invited to take appropriate governance roles. Our endgame? Decentralized governance, co-owned by everyone in the ecosystem. While we won't set a fixed date, our aspiriation is full decentralization around **5 years** into the main network's successful operation.

**On-Lattice Empowerment:** We understand "on-lattice governance" mechanisms are still unproven, but we're open to adopt on-chain governance mechanisms where practical.  Yet, we realise there might be times when off-chain governance is still a necessity.

In the world of Convex, governance isn't just a buzzword—it's our compass, guiding us towards a future where everyone has a stake and a say. Get ready for a journey of innovation, unity, and shared success!
