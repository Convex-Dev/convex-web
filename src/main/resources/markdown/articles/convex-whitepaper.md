# Convex White Paper

## Overview

Decentralised networks offer the opportunity to provide a true peer-to-peer system for the value exchange involving digital assets and services - a vision that might well be called the "Internet Of Value". However, existing decentralised networks have notable weaknesses including poor performance, high energy consumption, long transactions confirmation times, vulnerability to "front-running" attacks and/or lack of truly decentralised security.

We propose a novel solution based upon merging beliefs shared by peers using a function that is idempotent, commutative and associative, and thus creates a system that provably converges to consensus by forming a conflict-free replicated data type (CRDT). By augmenting this with a system of staking (DPoS), it is possible to guarantee convergence to consensus even in the presence of some proportion of malicious / byzantine peers.

We augment this system with an execution engine, building on the lambda calculus, immutable persistent data structures and content addressable storage. Coupled with the consensus algorithm, this provides a fully decentralised, global computer capable of executing arbitrary smart contracts with decentralised ownership (the "Convex Virtual Machine").

## Introduction

Convex is a programmable environment that is globally shared on a decentralised network: a "public computer" that everyone can access but where nobody has absolute control.

The motivation for the development of a system of this nature is because it can support a wide variety of decentralised applications. In particular, the "sweet spot" might be regarded as scenarios where there is a need for globally consistent shared state, but where a centralised solution is not desirable. Some examples might include:

* Games and entertainment where rules include ownership of digital assets
* Implementation of cryptocurrencies, utility tokens, and other forms of decentralised assets
* Economic transactions where terms and conditions are automatically guaranteed by Smart Contracts
* Educational environments for collaborative and interactive programming
* Immutable records of document / data provenance
* Publicly accessible databases and registries

Some highlights of the Convex design include:

* **Actors**: Programs that execute autonomously in the Convex environment with deterministic and verifiable behaviour, suitable for managing assets and enforcing Smart Contracts
* **Convex Virtual Machine (CVM)** - a fully Turing complete programming and execution environment, with a novel combination of language features to facilitate writing decentralised applications. We manage to implement a working Lisp compiler "on-chain".
* **Decentralised Data Object Model** - A data model supporting powerful features such as orthogonal persistence, memory accounting, incremental data sharing and cryptographic verification
* **Performance**: High throughput, low latency execution (many thousands of transactions per second, ~1 second or below latency)
* **Security**: Cryptographic security for control over all user accounts and assets, byzantine fault tolerance at the level of the decentralised network.

Convex builds on ideas around decentralised technology popularised through "blockchain" in recent years, but was motivated by a desire to build something better than current incarnations of blockchain technology can offer. Key motivations include:

* Provide a level of performance that makes decentralised applications practical for real work use cases
* Help the environment by supplanting systems based on Proof of Work
* Make decentralised software development more productive, engaging and fun
* Maintain a level of decentralisation that offers security and freedom from centralised control
* Establish new paradigms of programming around globally shared, consistent state

Convex is our attempt to create a system than can realise these possibilities. This White Paper provides an overview of its design and key capabilities.

## Context

### Towards a Digital Economy

Towards the end of the 20th Century, the foundational ideas were created for the Digital Economy. The start of the Information Age saw a wealth of innovation, as significant sectors of economic activity moved to the Internet:

* Online shops and marketplaces were developed, some of which became giant businesses (Amazon)
* Information and advertisements moved online (Google)
* Entertainment, games, media, communication and social activity moved online (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram)
* Many business activities and tools moved online (GitHub, Salesforce, Slack)

At the same time ideas were generated that hinted at the potential for economic value exchange *itself* to move to the internet:

* Digital currencies were proposed and implemented
* Key concepts able to enforce terms on Digital transactions such as Smart Contracts were introduced. 
* Innovations (both technical and legal) were developed to allow use of mechanisms such as digital signatures.

A problem with moving Value Exchange to the Internet, however, is that parts of the economic transaction still rely on pre-Internet mechanisms: traditional fiat currencies, paper-based contracts and centuries-old legal systems for enforcement. Execution of complete transactions usually depends on  trusting a single centralised entity to operate the interfaces between the Traditional and Internet worlds - handling legal issues, settling payments etc. Under such a model, economics of scale and network effects tend to favor a few commercial giants at the expense of smaller companies. This is a net loss to the economy: stifling innovation, excluding new competition, allowing monopolistic behaviour and "locking in" consumers without many practical choices.

### Decentralised Innovation

In 2009, Bitcoin was launched by Satoshi Nakamoto, which demonstrated for the first time that a digital currency could be operated on a fully decentralised, secure network using a Proof of Work consensus algorithm. The ability to prevent "double spending" using a purely decentralised, online method was a revelation that hinted at the possibility of entire economic systems migrating to the Internet.

In 2015, Ethereum was launched, which extended the concept of the Bitcoin network with a decentralised virtual machine (EVM) capable of executing Turing-complete smart contracts with a global state machine. This enabled a wave of innovations such as tokenisation of assets, and the first attempts at Decentralised Autonomous Organisations.

These innovations paved the way for significant experimentation in the space of digital currencies, tokenisation and cryptoeconomics.

### Technical Challenges

However, Blockchain technologies suffer from a range of issues which have proved hard to resolve. On the technical side, Ethereum founder Vitalik Buterin noted the "Scalability Trilemma" which is that is extremely hard to achieve the combination of:

* **Scalability** - Ability to offer performance comparable to traditional payment systems such as VISA
* **Security** - Resistance to attacks on assets and information integrity (such as double spending of digital currency)
* **Decentralisation** - Ability to operate free from centralised control by a single entity or group of powerful entities

Other technical challenges became apparent over time. Some notable issues:

* **Energy wastage** - The use of "Proof of Work" consensus algorithms has resulted in vast and wasteful energy consumption. This is particularly apparent in the Bitcoin and Ethereum 1.0 networks, which rely on vast amounts of computing power dedicated to hashing.
* **Unbounded state growth** has been noted in many contexts - on-chain state must in a blockchain in many cases be preserved indefinitely, but the economic costs of this often do not fall on those responsible for creating new state - leading to an instance of "the tragedy of the commons". Over time, this may make it impossible for normal machines to run a node, effectively halting decentralisation.
* **Front-Running** is a particularly important problem in decentralised finance, where it is possible to steal value from others by quickly inserting a transaction before that of another user, and is exacerbated by the problem of long block times
* **Cross chain integration** presents a particular problem where different decentralised platforms provide different specialised capabilities, but need to be integrated to form a combined solution. The problems of maintaining consensus, security, reliability etc. are magnified in such situations.
* **Latency** - The time taken for most blockchains to reach final consensus is too long to offer a positive user experience. This inability to provide quick confirmation and feedback is a significant barrier to mainstream user adoption of decentralised applications.
* **Upgradability** - Both networks themselves, and the specific implementations of smart contracts, are difficult to upgrade, in some cases requiring a "hard fork" of the network.




## Convex Overview

### The Convex Solution

Convex has been designed to solve many of the technical challenges of Blockchains. With reference to the Scalability Trilemma, Convex offers:

* **Thousands of transactions per second** - Convex will offer the capability to operate at VISA-like transaction levels and sub-second block times even *before* scalability solutions such as Layer 2 solutions, state sharding or optimistic lookahead approaches are applied.
* **Byzantine Fault Tolerance** - Convex meets the strongest possible threshold for security under the model of Byzantine threats. Consensus formation is guaranteed (and stable) as long as at least 2/3 of the effective voting power of the network follows the protocol.
* **Fully Decentralised** - The network operates under a trustless Peer-to-Peer model: Anyone can operate a Peer in the network, anyone can submit a transaction for execution, and transactions cannot be censored (subject to the usual security assumptions). 

But Convex is more than just a faster Blockchain - it is a platform for building digital economic systems. As such, it combines a number of capabilities that together enable construction of new classes of applications.

Three capabilities are particularly important:

* The **Consensus Algorithm** which enables the Convex network of Peers to agree on a consistent, replicated state of the world - essential to provide reliable confirmation of transactions in a decentralised system 
* The **Execution Engine** performs computations necessary to implement secured transactions on the Convex Network, and is the mechanism by which global state is updated and smart contracts are enforced.
* The **Storage System** enables Peers to store and manage data volumes with a level of scale and performance necessary to support a high throughput of transactions and data volume.


### Consensus Algorithm

Convex depends upon a consensus algorithm to ensure that everyone agrees on a single version of the truth - this is a precondition for any decentralised economic system that needs to enforce ownership of digital assets.

The Convex consensus algorithm makes use of **Delegated Proof of Stake**. This avoids the wasteful use of resources and energy that plagues systems based on "Proof of Work". As well as offering substantially improved performance, this means that Convex presents an environmentally friendly alternative to previous models such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.

The algorithm operates using a variant of a **Conflict-free Replicated Data Type** (CRDT), which can be proven to converge to consensus through a few rounds of random gossip between Peers. 

### Execution Engine

Convex implements a full virtual machine for smart contracts, the **Convex Virtual Machine (CVM)**. The CVM is designed to facilitate digital economic transactions, and offers some additional innovations to facilitate the development of decentralised applications:

* **Decentralised Data Objects** (DOs) - A system of data structures enabling efficient and secure replication of data across the Convex network, and supporting the implementation of the CVM. 
* **Convex Lisp** - A powerful language where CVM code is itself expressed as Decentralised Data Objects. The compiler itself executes on-chain - giving developers and Actors the power to construct, compile and deploy new actors on-chain without external tools. This enables systems of on-chain MetaActors - actors who can autonomously create and manage other actors.
* **Scheduled Execution** - The protocol allows for deterministic execution of Actor code at any future point in time. This allows for more advanced, time-based processes to be implemented on chain (without such a feature, smart contracts would need external systems and events to trigger execution at specific times, such as the Ethereum Alarm Clock )
* **Execution Worlds** - Each account on the network (external user or Actor) is granted a secure, scriptable code execution environment with its own database. This enables highly interactive use of the CVM by advanced users.

### Storage System

Convex implemented a novel storage scheme, specifically designed to support the requirements of Convex DOs. Key features of this system include:

* **Hash keys** - The key for every value in the database is its cryptographic hash
* **Smart References** - references to data that can be lazily loaded and verified, allowing just a small required subset of data to be accessed on demand.
* **Orthogonal Persistence** - Decentralised Data Objects used in Convex (such as the CVM state) are stored in a virtual database which may be much larger than main memory. This opens up interesting opportunities for future scalability and sophisticated Actors capable of working with large databases.
* **Novelty Detection** - The design of the storage system enables Convex to detect *novel* information when it is written to storage. This is important to reduce bandwidth requirements: only novel information will typically need to be broadcast to the Peer network.
* **Proofed Persistence** - Certain proofs relating the the validation of data are persisted along with the data itself. This is an important optimisation: Entire large data structures can be verified in O(1) time by checking the cached proof.

An important *excluded* feature is that of "update". Once written, data values are immutable and cannot be changed. This limitation is appropriate given that we are working with cryptographic hashes of keys: finding a different data value that maps to the same key would require breaking SHA3-256.

The database engine itself is called Etch. Etch is an embedded database engine optimised for these specific requirements. We believe that building a customised engine is a worthwhile investment, because of the specific feature requirements and performance improvements possible - perhaps a 5-10x speedup compared to using more traditional, general purpose databases.

The Storage System supports optional garbage collection for Peers that wish to compact storage size. A Peer is only required to maintain the current state, and a short history sufficient to participate in the consensus algorithm. Of course, Peers may choose to retain additional information for historical analysis.


## Technical Description

This section describes the key elements of the current implementation of Convex.

### State

At the core of the Convex design is the concept of the State.

The State is a representation of the complete information in the on-chain execution environment at any point in time. The Convex network as a whole operates as a globally replicated state machine, where new updates cause changes to the current State. Updates are defined on a globally consistent basis according to the sequence of transactions confirmed through the Consensus algorithm.

The State is internally represented as a Decentralised Data Object (DO) that includes:
*	All Account information and balances
*	All Actor code and state
*	All information relating to active Peers and staking
*	Global information (such as the latest Block timestamp)

Since it is a DO, it follows that a State is a Merkle Tree, and has a unique Object ID. This means that if two Peers compute a State update and announce the Object IDs, it is possible to immediately validate if they computed the same resulting State.

### Consensus Algorithm

#### Reduction to Block Ordering Problem

Consensus in the state of a decentralised machine can be achieved with the combination of:

* Agreement on some initial State: `S[0]`
* Consensus over the complete ordering of Blocks of transactions `B[n]` 
* A deterministic state update function, which updates the state according to the transactions contained in a Block: `S[n+1] = f(S[n],B[n])`

This construction reduces the problem of generalised consensus to the problem of determining consensus over Block ordering. The CVM execution environment provides the state update function, which is orthogonal to the consensus algorithm but provides the necessary state updates given a total ordering of Blocks.

We define the **consensus point** to be the number of Blocks confirmed by the consensus algorithm, and the **consensus state** to be the state obtained after applying the state update function up to the consensus point.

#### Block proposals

Traditional Blockchain solutions have focused on mechanisms to determine which participant gains the right to propose the next block, which includes a hash of the previous block in order to extend a linked chain of blocks. This was the basis for the original Bitcoin Proof of Work algorithm (which used the ability to mine cryptographic hashes as the basis for allowing a miner to publish a block and claim the corresponding block reward).

This approach of selecting a "leader" to publish a new block creates a couple of problems:

* It is difficult to determine which participant should be the next leader, in a way that is both efficient, provides security in the presence of potential byzantine actors, and is guaranteed to make progress in cases such as leaders becoming unavailable.
* Including the hash of the previous block in a chain creates an inherent data dependency that limits the ability to propose blocks in parallel and increases latency - each leader must build upon the work of the previous leader sequentially, which implies a minimum lower bound on the block time (given fundamental physical constraints).

Convex therefore eschews the idea of selecting a leader. **Any Peer may propose a new Block at any time**, and the new Block is independent of all previous Blocks, i.e. it does not form a "chain". A consequence of this is that is is possible for multiple Peers to propose valid blocks for inclusion in consensus at the same time.


#### Convergence

Convex uses a variant of Convergent Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)  to provide part of this solution. CRDTs have the provable property of Eventual Consistency - which might be informally defined as a situation where all peers eventually reach the same state given no novel transactions in the network.

This is achieved through:

* A data structure called a **Belief**, which represents a Peer's view of consensus across the whole network, including the most recent proposed Block orderings from other Peers
* A **Belief Merge function** for each Peer, which:
  * Combines any two (or more) Beliefs to create an updated Belief
  * Is idempotent, commutative and associative with respect to the merging of other Beliefs
  * Converges on a stable ordering of Blocks

This effectively forms a join-semilattice for each Peer, and satisfies the conditions required for a CRDT.

There is one subtle point that makes this different from a typical CRDT: Peers are only able to update the part of the Belief structure that represents their *own* proposals (this is enforced via digital signatures).

Convergence is guaranteed by a system of continuous voting. At each belief merge step, the Peer computes the total share of stake voting for each proposed Block in the next position after the current consensus point. It is able to do this because it has a view of the orderings proposed by all other Peers. 

This voting is applied iteratively to blocks in following positions, but only counting the votes by Peers that have supported the winning ordering up to this point (i.e. supporting a minority Block causes Peers to be excluded from the considered vote).

Once the overall winning ordering has been determined, the Peer appends any new Blocks it wishes to propose, then adopts this ordering as it's own proposal, which it communicates to all Peers.

This procedure naturally converges to a single ordering: Any situation where Peers are voting for different blocks is unstable and will collapse towards one outcome, since as soon as a slight majority is gained for any proposal it will cause other Peers to switch to supporting it. After a few rounds of gossip, the good Peers (at least) will start to converge on a the same ordering.

 

#### Stability

At some point, we therefore reach a threshold where greater than 2/3 of the Peers (by stake weight) are aligned in proposing the same ordering. This situation is **stable** because of the following logic:

* Since less than 1/3 of Peers are potentially malicious, the number of good peers in the agreed consensus set strictly outweigh the malicious peers.
* Even if all malicious peers were to act in concert and attempt to disrupt consensus (the worst case is where they initially support the ordering, then simultaneously switch to a new ordering), they would fail because they are outnumbered by good peers already in alignment, which would (probabilistically) secure the support of the majority of remaining non-aligned good peers and eventually reach the 2/3 threshold again.


#### Determining consensus

Once the threshold of Peers are observed by any Peer to be voting for the same ordering, the Peer marks and communicates this as a **proposed consensus point**. And once 2/3 of Peers are observed to have the same proposed consensus point with the same ordering, this value is taken by the Peer as the **new consensus point**. 

This is essentially a decentralised implementation of a 2-phase commit, and is used as a precaution against malicious Peers attempting to reverse consensus by changing their vote at the last minute (this might delay the consensus, but not stop it, since we are already past the tipping point where the good peers supporting the proposed consensus outweigh the bad peers).

#### Illustration

Consider a case where all peers A,B,C,D,E initially agree on an ordering (labeled `1`). At this instant, peer B receives a set of new transactions, and proposes an updated ordering `2`. Initially, this is unknown to all other Peers. We can visualise this situation as a Matrix, where each row is the Belief help by one peer, and each column represents the latest signed belief observed by each peer from another peer. Each Peer also has knowledge of the current consensus defined by `1`.

```
  ABCDE Consensus
 
A 11111 1 
B 12111 1
C 11111 1
D 11111 1
E 11111 1
```

At this point, Peer B "Gossips" its new Belief to other Peers. The other Peers observe that Peer B has proposed a new ordering, and incorporate this into their local view of Peer B:

```
  ABCDE Consensus
 
A 12111 1 
B 12111 1 
C 12111 1
D 12111 1
E 12111 1
```

With this information, all Peers are aware of a new ordering. They validate that this is compatible with the previous consensus, and because it is a valid extension of `1` they automatically adopt it as their own proposed ordering (the diagonal of the matrix).

```
  ABCDE Consensus
 
A 22111 1
B 12111 1
C 12211 1
D 12121 1
E 12112 1
```

Another round of gossip is performed. Now each peer is aware of the latest ordering `2` being communicated by all other Peers:

```
  ABCDE Consensus
 
A 22222 1
B 22222 1
C 22222 1
D 22222 1
E 22222 1
```

At this point, Peers are able to confirm that the proposed ordering appears to meet the threshold for a new consensus. However, they don't yet know that other Peers have confirmed this, so another round of gossip is performed to ensure that the 2-phase commit protocol is completed. After this round, all peers know that the consensus threshold has been met, and update their own view of consensus accordingly.

```
  ABCDE Consensus
 
A 22222 2
B 22222 2
C 22222 2
D 22222 2
E 22222 2
```

The network is now in a new quiescent state, with consensus advanced, and ready to process the next set of proposed transactions.

This illustration is a deliberate simplification. In practice:

* Multiple Peers may propose transactions at the same time. In this case, stake weighed voting would be used to determine which transactions are included first.
* The network might not reach a quiescent state before further new transactions are added. This is not an issue: consensus can be confirmed up to the point of the initial transactions while the new transactions are still being gossiped.
* Some Peers might misbehave, or be disconnected from the network. Again, this is not a problem as long as a sufficient number of good peers are still operating and connected, since the consensus threshold can still be met. Temporarily disconnected or offline Peers can "catch up" later.

#### A note on complexity

At first glance, the Convex consensus algorithm might be considered impractical because of the scale of data structures being shared. Consider a plausible high volume operating scenario:

* n = 1,000 Peers active in the network
* r = 10 new blocks per second
* s = 10k of data for each block (about 100 transactions)
* o = 1,000,000,000 Blocks of transactions in the current ordering (a few years of blocks)

Each Peer would theoretically be holding ~100 petabytes of information for their Belief, which would need to be transmitted in each gossip round, requiring a bandwidth in the order of many exabytes per second. Clearly this is not practical given current hardware or network capacity.

However, we exploit some powerful techniques to minimise this:

* Beliefs are represented as Decentralised Data Objects that support **structural sharing**: identical values or subtrees with identical values need only be stored once. Since orderings are identical up to the point of consensus, these can be de-duplicated almost perfectly.
* Peers are only required to actively maintain block data for approx. **1 day** (less than 10GB in this case)
* The Decentralised Data Objects support usage where only the **incremental change** needs to be gossiped. 
* The number of outgoing connections for each Peer is **bounded** to a small constant number of Peers that they wish to gossip to (typically around 10, but configurable on a per-peer basis)

With these techniques, Peers only need to gossip the novelty they receive (in this example around 100k per second, plus some accounting overhead) to a small number of other peers. Bandwidth required is therefore on the order of 2-5MB/s (allowing for some overheads and a reasonable number of Peer connections), which is certainly practical for any modern server with a reasonable network connection.

Overall complexity is therefore (factoring out constants):

* $O(r \times s)$ bandwidth, scaling with the rate of new transaction data size
* $O(r \times s)$ storage, scaling with the rate of new transaction data size
* $O(\log n)$ latency, scaling with the logarithm of number of Peers (based on standard analysis of gossip networks)

We believe this is a theoretical optimum for any decentralised network that maintains consensus over a global state. Lower latency could potentially be achieved by communicating to all peers simultaneously, however this would cause problems with bandwidth scaling.

#### A note on "front-running"

Front running is difficult with the Convex consensus algorithm. While theoretically possible, it would require a sophisticated and well-resourced attacker.

The main reason for this is that transactions are not visible to the network until *after* a new block has been proposed by a Peer and gossiped to the network, by which point it is already well on its way to being included in consensus.

A user concerned about front-running attacks should submit vulnerable transactions exclusively via a well connected, well-staked Peer (trusted not to be malicious, i.e. this Peer must itself not be participating in a front-running attack).

In this scenario front running attack would need to:

* Listen to vulnerable transactions broadcast on the network
* Quickly generate a new Block with the transaction(s) used to execute the front-running attack
* Have sufficient influence over consensus formation to ensure that the new Block is somehow re-ordered *before* the original Block (that is already approaching consensus)

Practically, this attack would require the attacker to have more resources (stake and network connectivity) than the original Peer *and all the good Peers it is connected to*, since the original Block would already be ahead by at least one round of gossip. Furthermore, the attack would be publicly visible and traceable to the Peer(s) that launched it: so even if successful the attacker would be vulnerable to blacklisting and/or real world legal repercussions.

Assuming good Peers are well-staked, and connect preferentially to other well-staked, trusted Peers with a known legal identity (which would be good practice, and should be configured as default behaviour), we believe such front running attacks will be generally impractical from an economic perspective.


### Execution Engine

The convex execution engine is referred to as the Convex Virtual Machine (CVM). This is a general purpose computational environment that can be used to implement the state transitions triggered by transactions.

#### Accounts

The fundamental control mechanism for the CVM is via Accounts.

* **User Accounts**: Accounts that are controlled by external users, where access is controlled by digital signatures on transactions.
* **Actor Accounts**: Accounts that are managed by an autonomous Actor, where behaviour is 100% deterministic according the the associated CVM code. Actor functionality may be invoked in a transaction, but only if this is initiated and validated via a User Account.

The Account model is conceptually similar to Ethereum: in particular the two types of Account share a common abstraction. Both User Accounts and Actor Accounts may hold exclusive control over assets, allowing for decentralised value exchange mediated by smart contracts.

#### Data Model

Convex implements a comprehensive set of data types, which are utilised both within the CVM and in the broader implementation of a Convex Peer (including the consensus algorithm and communication protocols).

All data types available in the CVM are considered as Decentralised Data Objects (DOs).

##### Primitive types

Eight integral primitive types are supported, consistent with a typical modern language and broadly equivalent to those available on the JVM:

* byte
* short
* int
* long
* float
* double
* char
* boolean

These behave generally as expected, with the important proviso that arithmetic is implemented exclusively using long and double types (other types are automatically upcast to long and double as required).

There is also a set of non-integral primitive objects generally useful for programming on the CVM:

* Keyword (`:foo`)
* Symbol (`bar`)
* String (`"Hello"`)
* Address (32 bytes hex, e.g. `1f6ca3a7a6fccc7a4ee8034a297b559ee7b343a1912aab89586126564dec166a`)
* Hash (32 bytes hex, e.g. `04ef3428895f2bccbf67a19e33f4a0ba0d9f67a0eb5eb1841cea13f6abff3134`)

Primitives that are sufficiently small are **embedded** directly within larger Data Objects that contain them. This is an internal implementation detail to reduce the overhead of storing many small objects independently, and is transparent to CVM code.

##### Nil

Convex supports the value `nil` as a first class value. 

By convention, core runtime functions generally return `nil` to indicate the absence of a value, e.g. looking up a value in a map with a key that is not present.

There is no direct equivalent of a `NullPointerException` since CVM objects do not implement methods, however careless use of nils may result in cast errors (e.g. `(+ 2 nil)`). 

##### Syntax Objects

Syntax Objects are wrapped values that contain a raw value and optional metadata. 

Metadata may be an arbitrary Map, but typically would include such things as:

* Source code references
* Documentation
* Information generated through macro expansion

Syntax Objects are inspired by Racket, and are generally used for code generation and compilation, although they are also available for use in regular CVM code if desired. They are marginally more efficient than storing a value and metadata as two separate fields in a Map, for example.

The primary usages of Syntax Objects within the CVM are:

* Allowing metadata to be attached to values within the dynamic environment of an Account (e.g. documentation for Actor functions)
* Supporting the implementation of the Convex Lisp compiler and macro system

NOTE: In the future Syntax Objects may be utilised to implement a gradual type system such as seen in Typed Racket.

##### Blobs

A Blob is an arbitrary-length sequence of bytes, and is considered a first class object on the CVM. 

Internally, Blobs are stored as a Merkle tree of chunks of up to 4096 bytes in length. Blobs may exceed the size of working memory: they can technically be up to 2^63-1 bytes in length. While the main Convex network is not designed for large object storage, they could plausibly be used in future as a basis for decentralised file storage, perhaps as a Layer 2 solution, in a manner similar to IPFS.

For many purposes, Addresses and Hashes can be also be treated as small fixed-length Blobs.

##### Data Structures

Convex supports a range of first-class data structures:

* Vectors (`[1 2 3]`)
* Lists (`(foo bar baz)`)
* Maps (`{:bar 1 :baz 2}`}
* Sets (`#{1 2 3}`

All data structures are immutable, functional data structures that support structural sharing based on an underlying tree representation (in fact, a Merkle tree). This generally provides efficient O(log n) operations for append, access, update etc. These data structures are similar to the data structures frequently found in modern functional programming languages such as Clojure, Scala or Haskell.

A moderately high branching factor (usually 16) is used. This is important because:

* It facilitates faster lookups (less nodes to traverse by a factor of 4 vs. a binary tree)
* It reduces the number of new node allocations required to update a path to a leaf node. 
* It reduces the number of hashes that need to be computed (a performance bottleneck in some cases)
* There is a certain elegance in being able to index the tree using hex digits


##### Records

Certain CVM structures are record types, e.g.

* AccountStatus
* PeerStatus
* State

These are primarily used by the Convex and CVM implementation, though for convenience they may be accessed and treated as Maps from field names to values in CVM code.

NOTE: Allowing user-defined, row-polymorphic records is under consideration for future implementation.

##### Functions

Functions are first class objects suitable for use in functional programming. 

Important features:

* Support for variable arity application, e.g. `(+ 1 2 3 4)`
* Full lexical closures (capturing values in the lexical environment at the point of creation)

In addition, data structures map be used in place of functions in some defined circumstances, e.g.:

* Maps may be used as functions that implement map lookup: `({:foo 1 :bar 2} :bar) => 2`
* Sets may be used as functions to test membership: `(#{1 2 3} 4) => false`
* Vectors may be used to perform indexed lookup: `([1 2 3] 2) => 3`

#### Execution constraints

Since the CVM supports Turing-complete computation, it is necessary to place constraints upon code execution to prevent erroneous, sloppily-written or malicious code from consuming excessive resources.

The CVM therefore constrains both **time** and **space**.

##### Time

Convex constrains time by placing a "juice cost" on each CVM operation performed. Any transaction executed has a "juice limit" that places a bound on the total amount of computational work that can be performed 

The originating account for a transaction must reserve juice by paying an amount `[juice limit] x [juice price]` at the start of the transaction. Any unused juice at the end of the transaction is refunded at the same rate. The juice price a dynamically varying price that adjusts with amount of execution performed per unit time by the Convex network as a whole: this is a cryptoeconomic mechanism to disincentivise transactions from being submitted at peak periods, and as a protection from DoS attacks by making it prohibitively expensive to flood the compute capacity of the network for a sustained period of time.

If the juice limit has been exceeded, the CVM terminates transaction execution with an uncatchable exception, and rolls back any state changes. No juice is refunded in such a situation.

##### Space

NOTE: FEATURE STILL IN DEVELOPMENT

A significant problem facing a global, decentralised database that provides a commitment to preserve data indefinitely is the problem of state growth: if not constrained, the size of the CVM state might grow excessively large.

This is an economic problem: The participants who create additional state are not necessarily the same as those who must bear the cost of ongoing storage. This can create a "Tragedy of the Commons" where participants are careless about creating new state. This could quickly lead to a situation where the state grows too large to be feasible for normal computers to participate as Peers in the Convex networks, which will in turn cause centralisation towards a few large and powerful nodes.

To solve this problem, Convex implements **memory accounting** with the following features:

* Every change to the state tracks the impact on **state size**, measured in bytes, which is (to a close approximation) the amount of memory that would be required to write out the byte encoding of the entire state tree.
* Each account has an allocation of **memory** to utilise. 
* When a transaction is executed, the **change in state size** is computed. An increase in state size reduces the accounts free memory, while a decrease in state size increases the account's free memory.
* If at the end of a transaction the incremental space exceeds free memory then the transaction will fail and be rolled back.
* Accounts may *temporarily* exceed their memory allocation during the course of transaction execution, e.g. through construction of temporary data structures. We can safely allow this because the maximum amount of temporary object allocation is bounded to a constant size by juice limits.

**Note 1**: that in practice, the actual storage size of the CVM state will be significantly smaller than the tracked state size, because the use of immutable persistent data structures allows many equal tree branches to be shared. The effectiveness of this structural sharing needs to be observed over time, but we anticipate perhaps a 2-3x reduction in state size may be possible in the long term.

**Note 2**: Observant system hackers may notice that the memory accounting mechanism means that if Account A causes some memory to be allocated, and Account B causes that same memory to be de-allocated (e.g. through the use of calls to an Actor), then Account B will gain memory from A. We consider this a feature, not a bug: It incentivises participants to clean up state wherever possible, and incentivises the writers of Actor code to consider their memory allocations and deallocations carefully.

To ensure correct economic behaviour, it is necessary for free memory to have an economic cost. Therefore, Convex enables a **memory market** though which memory allocations may be traded. This has the following features:

* An automatic market maker enabling accounts to buy and sell memory at any time, placing an effective price on memory
* A total cap on available memory set at a level that constrains the total state size to an acceptable level
* Ongoing governance to regulate changes in the total cap, which can be adjusted to allow for additional state growth as technology improves average Peer resources, without risking a loss of decentralisation.

The overall cryptoeconomic system of memory accounting and memory markets offers a number of important benefits to the Convex ecosystem:

* A guaranteed cap on state growth, that can safeguard against the growth of storage requirements driving centralisation
* A general incentive for all participants to minimise and manage memory usage. This incentive increases as total state size grows towards the cap.
* A specific incentive for coders to write memory-efficient code, and provide the ability for unused data to be deleted, if they want their Actors to be considered high quality and trustworthy.
* A partial disincentive to hoard memory allocations (since expected future cap additions may devalue large memory holdings).
* When space becomes scarce, there is an incentive for less economically viable applications to wind up operations and sell their memory allocation.

#### Runtime environment

The CVM defines a small runtime system ("core") that provides CVM capabilities to CVM programs. These include:

* Standard language control structures (loops, conditionals, error handling etc.)
* Basic numerical functions (focused on 64-bit integer and IEEE 764 double precision floats)
* Functions to manipulate and manage data structures (vectors, lists, maps sets)
* Control of assets native to the Convex network, such as balances and stake
* Ability to interact with Actors (deploying Actors, calling Actor functions)
* Functionality useful for managing CVM state updates, e.g. transaction rollback
* Language constructs necessary to support Convex Lisp (see below)

The core system is designed so that these low level capabilities can be easily composed to create higher level capabilities, through composition of data and functions.

At the same time, the capabilities of the runtime system are constrained so that they cannot break the rules of CVM execution necessary for deterministic state updates. There is no external IO capability, no ability for non-deterministic behaviour, and no ability to affect CVM state in a way that breaks the security model. CVM code is therefore "sandboxed" from the perspective of the Convex system as a whole.

#### Garbage collection

The CVM automatically garbage collects objects to which references are no longer maintained.

Peer operators may periodically choose to garbage collect old state from long term storage, or alternatively maintain old state for historical analysis. Peers are only required to maintain object information necessary to execute the consensus algorithm (belief structures plus the proportion of CVM state relating to Peer information and stakes).

#### Transparent persistence

The Convex execution engine implements a form of transparent (sometimes also known as orthogonal persistence). In this model, the CVM state size may exceed the working memory capacity of a Peer, and necessary parts of the state tree are loaded in from persistent storage on demand.

This presents a significant conceptual benefit for the developer: there is no need to write any code to load or unload data from storage in normal CVM code. This imposes some additional implementation complexity for the CVM itself, but this is considered a worthwhile trade-off, especially since it simplifies the logic of other parts of the Convex Peer implementation (e.g. eliminates the need to explicitly handle the memory consumption growth of block orderings generated by the consensus algorithm over time). 

#### Convex Lisp

The CVM includes a small, dynamically typed, embedded Lisp suitable for general purpose programming within the CVM environment.

Lisp was chosen as the first language implementation in Convex for the following reasons:

* It can be constructed using a very small number of axiomatic primitives, which in turn are based on the Lambda Calculus. This provides a robust logical and mathematical foundation, suitable for the type of verifiable, deterministic computations that the CVM must support.
* Lisp has a very simple regular syntax, homoiconic nature of code and ability to implement powerful macros. We hope this provides the basis for innovative new languages and domain-specific languages (DSLs) on the CVM.
* Lisp compilers are small enough and practical enough to include as a capability within the CVM, avoiding the need for external compilers and tools to generate CVM code.
* It is comparatively simple to implement, reducing the risk of bugs in the CVM implementation (which may require a protocol update to correct).
* Lisp is well suited for interactive usage at a REPL prompt. This facilitates rapid prototyping and development of Actors in a way that we believe is a significant advantage for decentralised application builders looking to test and prototype new ideas.

Developers using the Convex system are not required to use Convex Lisp: It is perfectly possible to create alternative language front-ends that target the CVM.

Convex Lisp draws inspiration from Common Lisp, Racket and Clojure. It is designed as primarily a functional language, with fully immutable data structures, as it is our belief that functional programming forms a strong foundation for building robust, secure systems.

#### Execution worlds

A feature of the Convex account model is that each account receives it's own programmatic environment where variables, data structures and code can be dynamically defined and updated. Definitions held within different accounts cannot collide: they have isolated namespaces.

* For User Accounts, this behaves like a small programmable sandbox completely under the control of the user account.
* For Actor Accounts, this can be used to store Actor code and state required for the operation of the Actor. The deployment of the Actor is in effect equivalent to creating the Actor Account and initialising the Actor's environment, with subsequent changes to the environment controlled by a set of exported functions that can be externally called.

We believe this is an useful model to encourage rapid development and innovation: for example, a developer can easily experiment with code in their own user account, then capture the same code in the definition of a deployable Actor for production usage.

#### Scheduled execution

The CVM includes a specialised data structure called the Schedule that references CVM code to be executed under a specific Account at a defined future timestamp.

The main purpose of the Schedule is to allow Actors to implement autonomous behaviour without the need to wait for an external transaction to trigger execution. This could be used, for example, to finalise a decentralised auction, to distribute the prize from a random lottery, to trade on a periodic basis, or to unlock assets that have been frozen for a specified period of time. 

The schedule is **unstoppable**, in the sense that once the consensus timestamp advances based a scheduled execution time, the associated code is automatically executed. This execution is guaranteed to happen before any other transactions in a block submitted on or after the same timestamp.

Scheduled executions currently cannot be cancelled, but this is not considered to be a serious limitation: Actors can simply implement code to ignore the event if it is no longer relevant.

### Convergent Immutable Storage

Convex makes use of a specialised storage system that complements the design of the Execution Engine.

#### Cells

Storage is constructed out of Cells. 

A Data Object may be represented as a single Cell, but for larger data structures a tree of Cells is necessary.


#### Encoding

All Cells have a unique Encoding.

The encoding is designed to provide the following properties:

* A bounded maximum encoding size for any Cell
* Very fast serialisation and deserialisation, with minimal requirements for temporary object allocation.
* Uniqueness of encoding - there is a 1:1 mapping between object values and valid encodings. This means that Data Object equality can be determined by comparing hashes of encodings.
* Self describing format: given an valid encoding, the Data Object can be reconstructed without additional context

#### Embedding

Small Data Objects are Embedded within another Cell (e.g. a Cell representing part of a larger data structure). In most cases, this avoids the need to construct and store separate cells for small primitive values.


#### Cell IDs as storage keys

The cryptographic hash of the Cell encoding is used an an identifier to refer to a Cell, and in particular as a key for storage system. 

This has the important property that it makes values in the storage system *immutable* - the data value cannot change for a given key. In turn this provides significant advantages for the implementation:

* No need to re-size values once written: the database can be accumulated in an "append-only" manner.
* No need for cache invalidation or synchronisation of replicas: values cannot change
* Rapid verification: if a hash exists in the store, and the data has already been validated, it must still be valid.

#### Convergence

Given the above design features, we are able to implement a system of immutable storage that is Convergent: Additional storage information may be merged into the store in a manner analogous to a CRDT.

It is a well-known result that taking the union of sets in a purely additive manner (a Grow-only Set) is a valid CRDT.

#### Status tagging

In additional to the raw data values, the storage system implements a system of status tagging, used to indicate the level to which a data value has been verified by the Peer.

The basic status levels are:

* **UNKNOWN** - The Peer has an identifier (Hash), but does not know yet if this is consistent with any encoded data
* **STORED** - The Peer has encoded data in storage which is validated to be a well-formed Cell (ignoring children), and consistent with the Hash.
* **PERSISTED** - The Peer has validated the structure of the Cell completely, including recursively validating all its children. At this point, we can rely on a Data Object represented by the Cell to be usable in CVM execution
* **ANNOUNCED** - The Peer has included the data in a publicly broadcast Belief

Some special status levels are also possible, including:

* **EMBEDDED** - A Data Object is able to be embedded within other Cells, and does *not* need to be individually stored.
* **INVALID** - A cell has been proven to be inconsistent with some validation rules. Such values cannot be used in the CVM, but caching the invalid status can be helpful to avoid the need to redo the validation.

This status tagging is compatible with being included in the storage CRDT, since:
* The status level can never go backwards: once verified, the result stands forever.
* Where there are two possible outcomes (valid or invalid, embedded or non-embedded) all Peers that perform correct validation must agree (i.e. it is effectively monotonic for any given data value)


#### Novelty detection

A key feature of the storage system is the ability to detect and apply special handling to novelty. Novelty is defined as a stored value that is moving up to a higher status level for the first time.

Novelty detection is important for the following reasons:

* When information needs to be shared on the network, only the incremental information needs to be transmitted. This is especially important for the consensus algorithm, for example: the transmission of a new Belief need only include the additions to the proposed Ordering, without communicating the complete Ordering (which may be very long, but is already likely to held by all other Peers)
* When validating data, it avoids the need to re-compute validation on parts of the data that have already been validated. This is particularly important when the data structures to be validated are large, but have only a few small changes in comparison with a previously validated data structure (e.g. the entire CVM State)

#### Garbage Collection

If we had infinite storage, we could just keep accumulating values in the database forever. However, practical concerns of storage limits will probably make this infeasible for most Peers.

Peers are only strictly required to maintain:

* Enough information regarding Beliefs to participate in the consensus algorithm (about one day of orderings and transactions?)
* The current State for the CVM

The storage system therefore allows garbage collection to be performed on a periodic basis, so that unused historical storage can be reclaimed. Garbage collection is done on a mark+copy basis, where currently used storage is copied to a new data file, and after which the old data file can be safely discarded. This could theoretically be performed concurrently with ongoing Peer operation in a future version.

This behaviour is of course configurable by Peer Operators - we expect some will want to maintain and index all historical data for analytical purposes.

### Cryptographic Primitives

Convex uses cryptographic primitives for the following functions.

* Digital Signature (Using Ed25519)
  * For every Transaction submitted
  * For every Block proposed by a peer for consensus
  * For every Belief shared by a peer on the gossip network
* Cryptographic Hashes (SHA3-256)
  * For every Cell which forms part of a Decentralised Data Object, a cryptographic hash of its byte encoding is computed for identity, indexing and verification purposes

As an engineering principle, Convex only uses trusted implementations of cryptographic algorithms in well tested libraries (currently Bouncy Castle, and the cryptographic routines available as standard in the JVM). We do not intend to "roll our own" with respect to crypto algorithms.

## Conclusion

Convex presents a new approach to programmable economic systems that provides a powerful combination of scalability, security and decentralisation, suitable for building applications for the Internet of Value.

At the same time, it maintains a certain degree of simplicity. We believe that simple, composable systems offer a more stable and secure foundation to build upon, and Convex therefore features:

* Simple functional programming on the CVM based on the lambda calculus
* Immutability for all data structures
* A comparatively simple consensus algorithm based on CRDTs

It is our hope that the innovations in Convex and the engineering decisions made will provide a practical, high performance platform for a new generation of decentralised applications.
