1. **Introduction and permission to use**

This document (the “**Policy**”) outlines the Convex Foundation’s project (the “**Project**”) policy for the use of our trademarks (the “**Marks**” are further detailed in Appendix 1 of this Policy). While our protocol is available under a [free and open source software copyright licence](https://github.com/Convex-Dev/convex/blob/master/LICENSE.md), the copyright licence does not include an express or implied right or licence to use our Marks. If you would like further information about our rights, these [can be made available on request](mailto:legal@convex.foundation).

The purpose of this Policy is not intended to limit the lawful use of our Marks. The purpose of this Policy is to prevent confusion amongst the community (and public at large) as to what we deem an appropriate use of our Marks and limit any misleading or damaging use of them. We also want to avoid any confusion about who are our official entities at the time of publication of this Policy. The official entities who are involved in this Project are:



1. [The Convex Foundation Ltd](https://convex.world), which is responsible for standardising, protecting, and promoting the Convex technology;
2. Convex Ecosystem Services Ltd,  which is responsible for building the Convex lattice technology; and 

We want to extend the use of our Marks as widely as possible insofar as such use is aligned with the 	 Project and its core mission values to standardise, protect and promote the Convex Protocol technology (the “**Values**”). This Policy describes what trademarks are covered by these guidelines, as well as uses of our Marks that are allowed without additional permission from us. If you want to use our Marks, or any other aspect of the Convex brand, in ways that are not described in this Policy, please contact us for [further information](mailto:legal@convex.world).

We want to encourage and facilitate the use of our Marks by the community since the Convex Project was built in a spirit of collaboration and open-source. However, we want to do so in a way that still ensures that our Marks are meaningful as a source and quality indicator for the Convex Protocol (the “**Protocol**”) and any associated products and services continue to embody the Protocol’s high reputation. This Policy therefore tries to strike the proper balance between: 

1) our need to ensure that our Marks remain reliable indicators of the qualities that they are meant to preserve, and 

2) our Convex community members’ desire to be full participants in the Project.

Notwithstanding this Policy, we reserve the right to withdraw any permission and/or amend, challenge or restrict any use of our Marks where we consider that such use amounts to a violation of this Policy or any use that we view as detrimental to the Project.

2. **Trademarks and usage**

The Marks that are covered in this Policy, from time to time, are owned by the **Convex Foundation Ltd**, Company number 12900166, with registered address located at: Russet Lodge, Hockering Road, Woking, England, GU22 7HG (further details of our Marks including any up-to-date information, such as registration details, are available on request [here](mailto:legal@convex.world)). The Marks comprise of Word Marks, Logos, and a combination of both, and are listed at Appendix 1.

[If you would like high resolution images of our Marks, including access to tools for embedding the same on websites, please email us at [legal@convex.world](http://legal@convex.world)]

Some of our marks may not be registered, but effective use of a trademark may give rise to parallel unregistered rights in accordance with the law of the applicable jurisdiction. This Policy covers our Marks whether they are registered or not and we may revise this Policy as appropriate from time to time in order to provide the Convex community with an up-to-date account of the Marks. This Policy and the rules contained herein are subject to change at any time. It is your responsibility to check this agreement periodically for changes.

2.1 **Universal considerations and rules of use**

Whenever you use one of the Marks, you must always do so in a way that does not mislead anyone, either directly or by omission, about exactly what they are getting and from whom. The law reflects this requirement in two major ways described in more detail below: it prohibits creating a “likelihood of confusion” but allows for “nominative use”. For example, you cannot say you are distributing the [Convex software code](https://github.com/Convex-Dev) (the “**Convex Code**”) when you’re distributing a modified version of it, because people would be confused because they are not getting the same features and functionality they would get if they downloaded the software directly from us. On the other hand, you may use our Marks to indicate that your product is compatible with the Convex Code or that your product accepts **GOLD** payments or is compatible with **sponsored ecosystem projects**, for example.

You also cannot use our Marks on your website in a way that suggests that your website is an official website of the Protocol or that Convex Entities endorse your website unless this is true. You can, though, say you like the Convex Code, that you participate in the Convex community and ecosystem, that you are providing an unmodified version of the Convex Code, or that you wrote a book describing how to get started using the Convex Code.

This fundamental requirement, that it is always clear to people what they are getting and from whom, is reflected throughout this Policy. It should also serve as your guide if you are not sure about how you are using the Marks.

Except for the “nominative fair use” of the Marks, your use of our Marks is subject to the following rules (irrespective of whether you received automatic or explicit permission for use):

**2.2 Rules for use:**

2.2.1 Any use of the Marks indicates acceptance of this Policy;

2.2.2 Wherever possible, the Marks should be accompanied by the trademark symbol **™** and the following text (or an appropriate translation), for example:

“Convex™ is a trademark of the **Convex Foundation Ltd**, Company number 12900166” or “Convex™ is a trademark of the **Convex Foundation Ltd**, Company number 12900166, with registered address located at: Russet Lodge, Hockering Road, Woking, England, GU22 7HG and other countries”

For materials in which only the Logo is displayed, or both the Logo and the Word Mark (Convex) are displayed:

“Convex™ and the Convex Logo™ are trademarks of **Convex Foundation Ltd**, Company number 12900166, with registered address located at: Russet Lodge, Hockering Road, Woking, England, GU22 7HG and other countries”; In particular, a ™ should not be changed to a ® in a trademark notice by anyone other than the owner. If you are unsure about whether our Marks are registered in your country, [please contact us for additional guidance as to what trademark symbol you should use.](mailto:legal@convex.world)

**Use of the Marks that is strictly prohibited:**

2.2.3 You may not alter the Word Marks or Logos, such as changing the proportions of the design elements or the design itself, rearrange the spacing, alignment, or relative locations of the design elements (you may resize as appropriate but must retain all proportions);

2.2.4 You may not, under any circumstances, use the Word Marks or Logos for illegal, defamatory or humiliating purposes, or any other purpose that may negatively impact the reputation of the Convex Protocol, Convex Code, or the Convex Entities;

2.2.5 You may not incorporate and or combine the Word Marks or Logos into a third party company’s marks, names, and or logos without prior written permission by Convex Foundation;

2.2.6 You may not use the Convex Word Marks or Logos in a manner that is not truthful and fair, or in a manner that may be derogatory, deceptive or misleading;

2.2.7 You may not use the Marks in ways that imply a greater level of sponsorship by or affiliation with Convex Foundation and or any of the other Convex Partner than actually exists;

2.2.8 You may not use or register, in whole or in part, the Marks as part of your own trademark, service mark, domain name, company name, trade name, product name or service name in any part of the world;

2.2.9 You may not use the Marks in association with the use or distribution of any software if you are also not in compliance with the copyright licence for that software;

2.2.10 Trademark law does not allow your use of names or trademarks that are too similar to ours. You therefore may not use, or otherwise register, an obvious variation of any of our Marks or any phonetic equivalent, foreign language equivalent, takeoff, or abbreviation for a similar or compatible product or service in any part of the world.

2.2.11 Any use of the Marks not permitted by this Policy requires advance written permission of the Convex Foundation. If you are unsure whether a use is permitted, please contact us for guidance.

You agree that you will not acquire any rights in the Marks and that any goodwill generated by your use of the Marks inures solely to the benefit of the Convex Entities.

**3. Permission for use:**

Written permission from Convex Foundation is required to use the Marks as part of your project or associated assets. For further information about how you can obtain our permission to use our Marks you can contact us [here](mailto:legal@convex.world).

**3.1 Use that does not require written approval:**

In some special cases, we will grant automatic permission for a project to use the Marks. Explicit permission to use the Mark is not required when a project meets the following criteria:

You exclusively use the Marks to either extend or improve the Convex Code, or to encourage the use of the Convex Code (in short — “foster the Convex Lattice Protocol software”), provided such use does not imply an official sponsorship or endorsement by the Convex Entities and only where this Policy is strictly observed.

Examples:



* Permitted use: An open access, free monthly newsletter called "Convex Weekly”
* Permitted use: A freely distributed Convex theme called “Gold Plated Convex”
* Not permitted: A Convex fork called eg. "A Non-Sucky Version of Convex”
* Not permitted: Selling T-shirts with the Convex logo to raise money for another cause

The Marks are used in a domain name, title of website, seminar, software package, book, magazine or video that is exclusively intended to support the Convex Code and Project, provided it does not imply an official sponsorship or endorsement by the Convex Entities and only where this Policy is strictly observed.

Examples:



* Permitted use: A non-commercial website called: howtoinstallConvex.com
* Permitted use: A keynote called “Getting Started with Convex”
* Requires Permission: A book titled “The Official Convex Lattice Guide”
* Requires Permission: A commercial website called Convexhosting.com

You want to display the official Convex logo (whether for commercial or non-commercial use) in a standalone and unaltered form, provided it does not imply an official sponsorship or endorsement by the Convex Entities and only where this Policy is strictly observed.

Examples:



* Permitted use: Putting the Convex Logo on your product packaging after you have and obtained our prior permission to do so
* Not permitted: Changing the colours or shape of the Convex logo for your purposes

You want to use the Marks in a descriptive manner to describe your product or services provided it does not imply an official sponsorship or endorsement by the Convex Entities and only where this Policy is strictly observed.

Examples:



* Permitted use: referring to your services as specialising in Convex development
* Permitted use: Convex Ecosystem Services Limited (CESL*) Convex Developers
* Not permitted: referring to yourself as “The Official Convex Consultant” or “Certified Convex Consultant" (this does not apply to the Convex Entities who may refer to themselves as Convex Consultants)

The press and media may make fair use of the Marks in reporting regarding its activities, function, research and products and publications. This also applies to any reporting about the activities of the Convex Entities and where the use of the Marks is necessary.

**3.2 Events and Meetups:**

You may use the Marks for the title of an event, camp or meet-up, but not in any manner that may imply official sponsorship or endorsement by the Convex Entities, unless such official sponsorship or endorsement exists. For example, using words like “conference” or, shorthand, “conf” and “foundation” may imply a degree of formality that could be construed by the Convex community that an official sponsorship or endorsement subsists. Accordingly, and where no such relationship exists between you and the Convex Entities, we require that you refrain from adopting this terminology in conjunction with your use of the Marks in order to avoid confusion about the nature of the event.

You may use the Marks in connection with events, camps, and/or meet-ups provided you strictly observe this Policy (including our rules of use set out in paragraph 2.2 and the requirements of this paragraph 3.2) and you follow the following requirements:

3.2.1 Your use of the Marks at the event, camp or meet-up reflects favourably on the products and services offered by the Convex Entities and on the Convex Protocol;

3.2.2 A disclaimer of sponsorship, affiliation, or endorsement by Convex Foundation, similar to the following, is included on the publication of event, camp or meet-up related electronic and or print marketing materials:

“This [EVENT] is independent of the Convex Foundation and the other Convex Entities and has not been endorsed, sponsored, or otherwise officially approved by them or their affiliates. Nothing presented at this [EVENT] constitutes financial or investment advice or is intended to be construed as financial advice provided by the Convex Foundation or the Convex Entities”;

3.2.3 Your name, and or name of the event, feature more prominently than your use of our Marks, where applicable, and on electronic and print materials at all times; 3.2.4 The event is located at an appropriate location and is hosted in accordance with applicable laws of the relevant jurisdiction, including but not limited to health and safety regulations.

Examples:



* Permitted use: Convex Annual Meetup 2023
* Permitted use: Convex (Developer) Bootcamp 
* Not permitted: ConvexConf London
* Not permitted: Convex Lattice Conference

**General guidance on Events and Meetups**

When organising an event, camp, and/or meet-up, please ensure that you have the time and resources required to organise them. For the benefit of our community and its members please also ensure that they are located in safe and easily accessible venues. It is important to bear in mind that these events should mirror our Values and we ask you to help us build upon the same through your participation. We want to keep engaged with the Convex community, and, so, if you want to run an event or have any questions regarding the use of the Marks, [please do not hesitate to ask us!](mailto:legal@convex.world)

**3.3 Use that does require written approval:**

In some specific cases, you will always require explicit permission from Convex Foundation in order to use the Marks. Even if you meet the criteria for automatic approval, you must always seek our permission to use the Marks if your project meets any of the following criteria:



* The use of the Marks suggests an “official link” between your product or service and the Convex Foundation;
* The use of the Marks is in a domain name;
* The use of the Marks is in an incorporated company name;
* The use of the Marks is used on specific branded products of goods and or services.

Examples:



* A domain called officialConvexfaq.org (this does not apply to the Convex Entities who may include the term ‘Official’ as a prefix in conjunction with the term ‘Convex’)
* A corporation named Convex Foundation Development Ltd
* A brand of ‘Certified Convex Support Agency ‘ or 'OFFICIAL Convex GOLD WALLET’ (this does not apply to the Convex Entities, namely CESL)

The Marks are used as part of a “Convex.tld” top level domain name.

Examples:



* Convex.ly
* Convex.info
* Convex.eu

The Marks are used as part of a domain name that covers an entire category of products or services that are relevant to the Convex community.

Examples:



* Convex-Themes.com
* Convex-Plugins.org
* Convex-Tshirts.us
* Convex-Mobile.co.uk
* Convex-Magazine.eu
* Convex-Hosting.net

The Marks are used as part of the name of a company, organisation, trade name or association.

Examples:



* Convex Users Germany
* Convex Inc
* Convex Bloggers Association

You would like to use the Marks as a part of an advertising campaign.

Examples:



* Google Adwords/Adsense
* Facebook promoted posts
* A television advertisement

If you’re not sure whether your use of the Marks qualifies for automatic approval or not, [please do not hesitate to ask us!](mailto:legal@convex.world)

**3.4 Use Specimens**

In some jurisdictions, we may be required to demonstrate the use of our trademarks after a certain period of time in order to maintain their validity. It is, therefore, in the benefit of the whole Convex community that where you use our Marks, you agree to provide the Convex Foundation with specimens and/or documents that demonstrate your usage of our Marks in order to support Convex Foundation to maintain and enforce its rights where such maintenance and enforcement is subject to use evidence. We may contact you and request that you provide us with such evidence from time to time.

**3.5 Applying for Permission**

If you would like to apply for permission to use the Marks based on the guidelines above, [please email us](mailto:legal@convex.world) directly including your full details and the details of your requested use.

Your application will be considered against the following criteria which considers whether the product or service in question:

3.5.1 Promotes Convex usage around the world; 3.5.2 Is released under an open source licence compatible with this Policy and or any applicable Convex licence; 

3.5.3 Is created by significant contributors to the Convex Code and supporters of the open Project; 

3.5.4 Has a positive impact on the overall Convex community; and 

3.5.5 Does not lead to confusion about being an official project of the Convex Entities.

Where you plan to generate a profit on your use of our Marks – for example, if you intend to sell merchandise bearing the Marks, we may require you to enter into a sub-licence with us where any applicable licence fee (after reasonable overhead expenses) will go to support the Convex Foundation and Project.

We ask that you submit any requests to us at a reasonable time before you require our approval so that we may give appropriate consideration to your intended use of our Marks. If we do not respond within three (3) months, this will be deemed as a rejected application.

**4. Proper trademark use**

These rules hold true for all trademarks, not just ours, so you should follow them for our Marks as well as anyone else’s.

**Use of trademarks in text**

**Always distinguish trademarks from surrounding text with at least initial capital letters or in all capital letters.** Unacceptable: convex, convex foundation Acceptable: Convex, Convex Foundation

**Always use a trademark as an adjective modifying a noun.** Unacceptable: This is a Convex. Anyone can install it.  Acceptable: This is a Convex application. Anyone can install it.

**Don’t use a trademark as a verb. Trademarks are products or services, never actions.** Unacceptable: I Convex’d my computer today! Acceptable: I installed the Convex protocol on my computer today!

**Don’t use a trademark as a possessive. Instead, the following noun should be used in possessive form or the sentence reworded so there is no possessive.** Unacceptable: Convex’s install interface is very clean. Acceptable: The Convex install interface is very clean.

**Don’t translate a trademark into another language.**

**5. General**

In order to protect the Convex community, we ask that **you help us by reporting** any suspected illegal or criminal use of our Marks by a third party of which you may become aware, together with any information, and assistance, in relation to any such use of our Marks. This way we can continue to build upon the communal and collaborative effort to protect and enhance the Convex ecosystem and continue to maintain its reputation. The Convex Foundation gives no warranty and makes no representation in or pursuant to this Policy that the use of the Marks, nor the manufacture, use, sale or other dealing in any of the Convex Code, does not or will not infringe the rights of others. Any use of the Convex Marks should be in accordance with applicable legislation and subject to any third party’s pre-existing intellectual property rights in the relevant territory. The Convex Foundation shall not be liable for any claims relating to user’s activities falling within the scope of the permission and the user hereby agrees to indemnify, defend, and hold the Convex Foundation and its contributors harmless against any such claims. The Convex Foundation reserves the right to withdraw any right granted to you to use the Marks at its discretion, if we consider that such use damages the reputation of the Convex Foundation, the Convex Entities, and or the Project, or where any use of the Marks fulfils any unlawful activities or damages other members of the Convex community. Any right to use the Marks and any dispute or claim (including non-contractual disputes or claims) arising out of or in connection with this Policy and its subject matter or formation of the same shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of England and Wales.
