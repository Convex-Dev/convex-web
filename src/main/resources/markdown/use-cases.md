Convex is a general purpose, programmable decentralised network with global state. As such, there is no inherent limit on the nature of applications that can be built. Here are some of the things that Convex can be used for, and are being actively developed within the Convex community:

## NFTs

Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) are a powerful mechanism for creating unique virtual items that can be owned, collected traded and utilised in virtual environments such as games. Each NFT has a unique on-chain ID and can be individually addressed, transferred and used within smart contracts.

Convex includes a powerful NFT engine based on set theory, capable of millions of NFT transfers per second, and allowing arbitrary metadata and smart contract rules to be attached to individual NFTs.

## DeFi

Convex provides comprehensive support for decentralised finance applications.

As part of the full-stack solution we offer:
- A uniform, fungible token model suitable for utility tokens, stablecoins, governance tokens and more.
- An advanced decentralised token exchange based on constant liquidity pools allowing for efficient trading of fungible tokens of all types.
- Template smart contracts and libraries for creating and interacting with DeFi assets
- Capabilities to delegate control of assets to intermediaries, custodians or decentralised smart contracts
- Capabilities for digital asset governance including trusted smart contract upgrades

## Gaming

Games need fast interactive performance and shared global state for immersive multiplayer worlds. With blazing fast performance (just milliseconds for transaction confirmations) and minimal transaction costs, Convex is the perfect platform for decentralised gaming, virtual items and in-game currencies.

Our first game is a 3D block game inspired by Minecraft, Boulderdash and the Roguelike genre. The entire game world is implemented as a set of Convex Actors. Transactions are automatically executed when the player takes actions that change the world state, and the player can otherwise view and explore the world at zero cost.

## Metaverse

Convex provides the ideal substrate for the convergence of real and virtual worlds into new shared realities. With a rich model of digital assets and on-chain smart contract capabilities, we can help you craft the next generation of experiences in virtual reality.

Our metaverse innovation includes the world's [first fully on-chain 3D game world](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=op2NccyMEBE).

## Payments and Retail CBDCs

Convex supports an [advanced model of digital currencies](https://www.youtube.com/live/XHxEnqBwgN8?feature=shared&t=95) with customisable governance, suitable for CBDCs and other currencies with trusted issuers. Our [open source mobile wallet](https://github.com/Convex-Dev/convexity) (Convexity) makes these easily accessible and convenient for users, and can be customised to create branded experiences with additional functionality.

With incredible performance, low costs and low latency, Convex digital currencies are ideal for consumer use cases such as digital payments, international transfers and retail purchases.
