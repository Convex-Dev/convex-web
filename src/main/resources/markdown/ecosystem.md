Blockchain ecosystems depend upon collaboration.  Enterprises and entrepreneurs develop secure centralise databases or blockchain apps to deliver their unique business value.  Almost inevitably they need to interact with other real-world systems, such as payment systems and supplier apps.  The other parties may already have their own blockchains or decentralised ledger technology (DLT).  Interoperability is now a critical success factor for enterprise growth.  Currently most systems interoperate via conceptually simple, bi-directional, APIs.  This strategy is not globally scalable as the number of partners increase.  Convex can now provide the capacity and security at low cost.

The Convex test network acts as a value exchange hub for any cryptographic tokens.  Convex Coins provide a universal, decentralised medium of exchange via the Torus.



## Builders

If you are looking for the best platform to build your decentralised application or use case, you are at the right place! We support all innovators and entrepreneurs building on top of the Convex platform, who may also be eligible to receive grants from the Convex Foundation

## Community

We are a diverse, international, open community and welcome anyone who wants to participate in the Convex ecosystem. Discussions happen primarily on the [Convex Discord](https://discord.com/invite/fsnCxEM) and technology development is fully open source on [GitHub](https://github.com/Convex-Dev).

## Coin Purchasers

Prior to the main network launch, we will not be offering Convex Coins retail. Institutional coin purchasers willing and able to make a substantial purchase of Convex Coins are welcome to contact us at [info@convex.world](mailto:info@convex.world).
