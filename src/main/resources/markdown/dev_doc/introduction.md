Convex has developed Lattice Technology for the digital economy. It's the most powerful platform for developers of decentralised applications and digital assets.  
- The [Convex Virtual Machine (CVM)](/cvm) delivers smart contracts and digital assets, plus flexible and scalable off-chain computation.
- Convergent Proof of Stake provides real-time performance and global scalability with strong security.
- Lattice data structures â€“ globally scalable for decentralised filesystems, content delivery, AI, big data and more
- Use Convex directly! Create a free account and run transactions live at the [Sandbox](/sandbox). You can create smart contracts directly with our interactive REPL.
- A set of tools provides analytics and interaction with the current [Test network](/testnet).
We are an Open Source community, and discussion often takes place on the [Convex Discord Server](https://discord.com/invite/xfYGq4CT7v). Join up for lively discussion, collaboration, announcements and more!
