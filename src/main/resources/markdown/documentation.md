This section of `convex.world` is dedicated to helping people learn about and build solutions using Convex.

If you are new and want to get a taste of using Convex, we recommend starting with the [Getting Started Guide](/documentation/getting-started). This guide will take you from the very basics of how Convex works through to launching your own Token!

If you are a more experienced developer and want to learn more about Convex Lisp and the CVM, check out the [Lisp Guide](/documentation/tutorial). This guide introduces the Lisp language, and how to use it to access the advanced features of Convex.

The [Advanced Topics](/documentation/advanced-topics) section covers more sophisticated capabilities of Convex such as security, macros and the on-chain compiler. We'll be updating this over time to cover all the advanced features.

There are also reference sections for the Convex Core Library and the Client API - essential tools for anyone building applications and smart contracts.

We hope you enjoy learning about Convex! If you have questions or feedback, please join us on the [Convex Discord Server](https://discord.gg/fsnCxEM).
